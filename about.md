Hi, I am a begginer Japanese learner. At the time of writing this post, I have been learning Japanese for about a year and half. In this time, I have made some progress towards my goal of one day speaking Japanese, but I still have a long way to go.

I believe that one of the best way to learn anything is to try to explain it to yourself. So up until now, I have been writing tiny lessons dedicated to myself. I have shared these lessons to a friend of mine who suggested that I should start a blog.

This blog will contain lessons mostly aimed at my own self-growth in Japanese, as well as some extra ressource that I would find handy as a Japanese learner..
