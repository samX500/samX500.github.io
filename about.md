When I began learning Japanese, I decided that every single day I would write for myself a short lesson. These lessons could be about anything, they are often simple rephrasing of other Japanese blog, somtimes it is a translation of some sentence I came accross and some other times it was just anything other related to Japanese. This was to start forming a hard to break habit of learning more about the language everyday. 

At first, these lessons were intended only as a study tool for myself, but a friend of mine suggested that I share them on a blog. I don't think these lessons are of such good quality to publish, since they are hastily made to fit in my daily schedule and I am still not very good in Japanese, but I warmed up to the idea of publishing them anyway. If anything this site will serve as an interesting journey of someone trying to learn Japanese.

Along with the date each post is made, I have decided to also include the time it has been between that post and me starting Japanese.
