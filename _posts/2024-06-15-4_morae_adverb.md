    4 Morae Adverb
---

In Japanese, there are a lot of adverbs that follow a similar format. They are composed of exactly 4 morae, contain a っ and end in り. For example, しっかり, ゆっくり and はっきり are some of the most common example of such adverbs. [imabi.net](https://imabi.org/4-morae-adverbs/) made a post on them calling them 4 morae adverbs. I have encounreted many of these 4 morea adverb while learning Japanese, and they are some of the hardest words to memorise due to the similarity between all of them. So I thought I'd make a list of all the 4 morea adverb I have encountered so that I can come back to remind myself of them.

If you want to look at a more exhaustive list, I recommand looking up the original post by [imabi.net](https://imabi.org/4-morae-adverbs/). There is also a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/tprdou/comment/i2cst8o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that lists them based on their frequency in the netflix corpus.
